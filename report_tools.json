Not because I think it doesn't require rework, but currently when I tell my clients about pdk-templates I just say it works like modulesync. Which is well documented and used by many.  \r\n\r\nWhile, the current implementation isn't perfect, making the user switch to another system is going to piss them off.   Many users coming from the modulesync workflow will start using pdksync with PDK.  So for a large corporation to convert to PDK and forgetting everything about how modulesync is a hard pill to swallow.\r\n\r\nRegarding the opt-in strategy.  This seems ideal.  I like it.  \r\n\r\nThe way I use pdk-templates is always the same:\r\n1. Mirror official external templates into internal git repository\r\n2. Fork the internal mirror into a namespace that is intended for heavy internal usage\r\n3. Make changes that are reflective to my environment\r\n4. Remove all calls to the internet (rubygems.org, puppet.com, github.com)\r\n5. Add all my exclusions to the template_configs\r\n6. Create branches for each tag of the upstream templates\r\n\r\nWith this in mind there should be an air-gaped setting too.  Provide a way to fill in special environment variables in the templates.yml that are then used in the template rendering.\r\n\r\n```yaml\r\n\r\npdk_templates:\r\n  config: \r\n    air_gaped: true\r\n    GEM_SOURCE: \"ENV['GEM_SOURCE']\"\r\n    ci_system:\r\n      - travis\r\n      - appveyor\r\n    scm_system: github_enterprise\r\n    upstream_template_repo: github.com/puppetlabs/pdk-templates\r\n    internal_template_repo: github.com/nwops/pdk-templates  \r\n```\r\n\r\nOn a side note.  What I would like to see is the templates.yml file become the configuration code for describing an environment.  Take the upstream pdk-templates from puppet and \"merge\" them with an internal (subset).  Whereby,  the internal subset files take precedence over the upstream version. This should be similar in behavior to `Hash.merge.`   What this might look like:\r\n\r\n1. pdk new module --template_url=https://github.com/nwops/pdk-templates.git\r\n2. pdk clones https://github.com/nwops/pdk-templates.git\r\n3. pdk references the templates.yml file and finds the upstream_template_repo\r\n4. pdk clones the upstream template repo\r\n5. pdk starts to create new files and looks for template in internal_template_repo first and fails back to upstream templates for the requested template. \r\n\r\nThis keeps the user from having to keep an extra fork of pdk-templates around and constantly maintain them with upstream changes.
