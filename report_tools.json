Puppet Strings does appear to be intended only to document a single module. I haven't finished my work to document a Control Repo using Puppet Strings, but you can see my work in progress [here](https://github.com/alexharv074/elk/commit/eef7206d857af5e7bc0b02bf7c4c44f27f43a119). After applying the patch in this pull request, I could generate Markdown from classes inside a site directory.\r\n\r\nSee also how I used Puppet Strings [here](https://github.com/alexharv074/puppet-firewall_multi/blob/master/.README.erb#L3-L34) and [here](https://github.com/alexharv074/puppet-firewall_multi/blob/master/.README.erb#L104) to include Markdown in one of my module's READMEs, and my blog post [here](https://alexharv074.github.io/2018/11/09/generating-markdown-from-source-code-in-erb.html) on how I generally use ERB to generate nearly all my README files. Since I think all duplication in docs is bad, I do think Puppet Strings's job should be extended beyond just documenting modules.","by":"alexharv074","age_comment":349},{"tool":null,"address":"https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppet_pot_generator","pr":21,"age":7,"owner":"dependabot-preview[bot]","title":"Update rake requirement from ~> 10.0 to ~> 13.0","last_comment":"0 comments","by":"","age_comment":0},{"tool":null,"address":"https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppet-resource_api","pr":262,"age":7,"owner":"dependabot-preview[bot]","title":"Update rake requirement from ~> 10.0 to ~> 13.0","last_comment":"Can one of the admins verify this patch?","by":"puppetlabs-jenkins","age_comment":7},{"tool":null,"address":"https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppet-resource_api","pr":256,"age":45,"owner":"bastelfreak <span class='badge badge-secondary'>vox</span>","title":"move codeowners to .github/","last_comment":"Can one of the admins verify this patch?","by":"puppetlabs-jenkins","age_comment":45},{"tool":null,"address":"https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppet-resource_api","pr":254,"age":45,"owner":"bastelfreak <span class='badge badge-secondary'>vox</span>","title":"Add Ruby 2.7.0 to Travis-CI matrix","last_comment":"Depends on https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppet/pull/7919","by":"bastelfreak","age_comment":45},{"tool":null,"address":"https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppet-resource_api","pr":255,"age":45,"owner":"bastelfreak <span class='badge badge-secondary'>vox</span>","title":"Add `puppet` as runtime dependency","last_comment":"mhm, this requires some rework on the travis configuration","by":"bastelfreak","age_comment":43},{"tool":null,"address":"https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppet-resource_api","pr":253,"age":45,"owner":"bastelfreak <span class='badge badge-secondary'>vox</span>","title":"add Ruby 2.6.5 to test matrix","last_comment":"Can one of the admins verify this patch?","by":"puppetlabs-jenkins","age_comment":45},{"tool":null,"address":"https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppet-resource_api","pr":261,"age":7,"owner":"dependabot-preview[bot]","title":"Update rubocop requirement from ~> 0.57.0 to ~> 0.80.1","last_comment":"Can one of the admins verify this patch?","by":"puppetlabs-jenkins","age_comment":7},{"tool":null,"address":"https://github.com/puppetlabs/rubocop-i18n","pr":35,"age":7,"owner":"dependabot-preview[bot]","title":"Update rake requirement from ~> 10.0 to ~> 13.0","last_comment":"0 comments","by":"","age_comment":0},{"tool":null,"address":"https://github.com/puppetlabs/rubocop-i18n","pr":36,"age":7,"owner":"dependabot-preview[bot]","title":"Update bundler requirement from ~> 1.17.3 to ~> 2.1.4","last_comment":"0 comments","by":"","age_comment":0}]
