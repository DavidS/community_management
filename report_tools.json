If this happens, the test will fail, because of `Hocon.load(...)` mock. To safeguard agains this edge case, we should consider this PR.","by":"IrimieBogdan","age_comment":7},{"tool":"Rubocop::I18n","address":"https://github.com/puppetlabs/rubocop-i18n","pr":36,"age":33,"owner":"dependabot-preview[bot]","title":"Update bundler requirement from ~> 1.17.3 to ~> 2.1.4","last_comment":"0 comments","by":"","age_comment":0},{"tool":"Rubocop::I18n","address":"https://github.com/puppetlabs/rubocop-i18n","pr":35,"age":33,"owner":"dependabot-preview[bot]","title":"Update rake requirement from ~> 10.0 to ~> 13.0","last_comment":"0 comments","by":"","age_comment":0},{"tool":"Rubocop::I18n","address":"https://github.com/puppetlabs/rubocop-i18n","pr":37,"age":21,"owner":"dependabot-preview[bot]","title":"Update pry requirement from ~> 0.12.2 to ~> 0.13.0","last_comment":"0 comments","by":"","age_comment":0}]
