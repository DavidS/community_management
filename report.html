<td>I can get ctorigdst/ctorigdstport et al. working by adding whitespace to the end of the include? comparison in the module argument mapping. There _should_ be a space after every iptables argument it is matching, and it makes it unique. It is not very elegant... is there a better way? It would apply to every module.

<td>Hello @elfranne ,

Currently we're using puppet-litmus for running acceptance tests. This replaces beaker as the test runner. To run the acceptance tests follow the instructions from this point [here](https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppet_litmus/wiki/Tutorial:-use-Litmus-to-execute-acceptance-tests-with-a-sample-module-(MoTD)#install-the-necessary-gems-for-the-module).
Here is a useful documentation on how to add unit tests using[ rspec-puppet](https://puppet.com/blog/unit-testing-rspec-puppet-for-beginners)
To add new unit tests for that here is an example for [manage_config_file](https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppetlabs-mysql/blob/178327a897a5122618f058d0a1aac2cbfc618324/spec/classes/mysql_server_spec.rb#L24). Another example for[ mysql::server::backup](https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppetlabs-mysql/blob/178327a897a5122618f058d0a1aac2cbfc618324/spec/classes/mysql_server_backup_spec.rb#L3). I hope these examples will help you. If you need help, please contact us! Thanks!

Can you please provide me the errors? Also your set-up steps please? maybe the platform is not completely configured.

```

```
travis_el7:
  provisioner: docker_exp
  images: ['waffleimage/centos7', 'waffleimage/oraclelinux7', 'waffleimage/scientificlinux7']

The spec test seems to have been spaces since it was refactored from `database_user`, so I think this is actually broken in the real world, it's just lucky that the commonly used fields rarely if ever have spaces.

The changelog there states

 07/27/2015:
-Added Domain Join detection to PendComputerRename, DOES NOT currently detect Workgroup Join/Change.

Further note that facts for  `:vardir, :environmentpath, & :server` already exist im just extending this interface to add a few more  and creating a structured fact

Of course others may not find theses useful at all and this PR can get rejected but im not sure they would make more sense going into a different module.  Of course im open to suggestions if there is a more appropriate module

<td>(WIP) Add volatile_fact() function</td>
<td>So, there are issues with getting the facts if not set in scope as `$facts`, a) risk of getting server side facts when called on master and b) if there are many "deferred facts" they would all result in running Facter and this would be slow c) since each call will run Facter, the values may differ for the same fact
 
The best would be if the facts were already present in scope when deferred calls are resolved. That requires a change to Puppet however as the setup and use of PAL on the agent side for resolution of Deferred must be given the facts to use. (The rest should already be supported by PAL; i.e. setting `$facts` etc.)

If not computed and set up front, then I think the result needs to be cached and kept while resolving deferred values. This would be good since if there is no call to get a deferred fact then Facter does not need to run at all. If going this route, there is a supported caching mechanism that functions can use. With this there is still the problem of getting the wrong facts (for server when agent was intended) as the place intention is known is when setting up the context (i.e. when setting up PAL for resolution, or when setting up for apply, master compile, bolt apply compile, etc.).</td>

I didn't observe it because I was doing all of my testing in an interactive
environment. I never arranged puppet to run as a daemon and apply the
catalog in such a way that would test the failure scenario experienced in
the interactive environment.

Thank you. I appreciate the commentary.

My only concern with the whitelisting environment variables is "What is the
definitive list of variables that need to be whitelisted in order for the
git commands to work?"

That seems like a larger and more disruptive change that is more
challenging to test to see if all scenarios still work as expected.

This PR is pretty minimal and fixes a bug. I guess if the more optimal
solution is available, then advocating for rejecting this one is sensible,
but if that patch never materializes, then the perfect is the enemy of the
good.

After further testing, when setting depth == 1, the specific revision was not present in the git clone. Do you have any guidance on how to fix this so that it's possible to checkout out the specific rev #? Guess that's why the tests were broken, because the code was broken :)</td>
