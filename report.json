Trying to break them  into several lines might make the code difficult to understand. There might be a rubocop linter problem complaining about putting a regex into %r{}, as this should be done only when trying to match a \"/\" - which is not the case here as the slashes just enclose the regex.\r\n\r\nWould be happy for some advice here.","by":"janit42","age_comment":1,"num_comments":1,"no_comment_from_puppet":true,"last_comment_mentions_puppet":false},{"repo":"puppetlabs-accounts","address":"https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppetlabs-accounts","pr":289,"age":11,"owner":"sheenaajay <span class='label label-warning'>puppet</span>","title":"DO NOT MERGE Testing Honeycomb update","last_comment":"# [Codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/puppetlabs/puppetlabs-accounts/pull/289?src=pr&el=h1) Report\n> :exclamation: No coverage uploaded for pull request base (`release@d40c5d4`).

Try 'apt-get -f install' with no packages (or specify a solution).`\r\n- For the PLATFORMS=el6_puppet5 it seems to be problems with the metadata to install the percona package for some of the OSes tested\r\n\r\nI recommend you try to run the installation of the percona package manually from inside the containers to debug these issues a bit easier. Using Litmus you can provision the images on your machine using: \r\n`bundle exec rake litmus:provision['docker_exp','waffleimage/debian8']`\r\nIn order to run the tests install the puppet agent and module using `bundle exec rake litmus:install_agent[puppet5]` and `bundle exec rake litmus:install_module` \r\n\r\nIn your inventory.yaml (will be created after the provisioning) file you will find the necessary details to ssh into the container and run manually from there.\r\n","by":"carabasdaniel","age_comment":9,"num_comments":10,"no_comment_from_puppet":false,"last_comment_mentions_puppet":false},{"repo":"puppetlabs-mysql","address":"https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppetlabs-mysql","pr":1196,"age":274,"owner":"Spuffnduff","title":"Allow backupcompress for xtrabackup profile","last_comment":"Looking at the current .travis.yml file in my branch, it passes expect for Puppet v.4 which shouldn't matter.

That requires a change to Puppet however as the setup and use of PAL on the agent side for resolution of Deferred must be given the facts to use. (The rest should already be supported by PAL; i.e. setting `$facts` etc.)\r\n\r\nIf not computed and set up front, then I think the result needs to be cached and kept while resolving deferred values. This would be good since if there is no call to get a deferred fact then Facter does not need to run at all. If going this route, there is a supported caching mechanism that functions can use. With this there is still the problem of getting the wrong facts (for server when agent was intended) as the place intention is known is when setting up the context (i.e. when setting up PAL for resolution, or when setting up for apply, master compile, bolt apply compile, etc.).","by":"hlindberg","age_comment":78,"num_comments":7,"no_comment_from_puppet":false,"last_comment_mentions_puppet":false},{"repo":"puppetlabs-stdlib","address":"https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppetlabs-stdlib","pr":1004,"age":345,"owner":"Rathios","title":"(MODULES-8732) Cron types","last_comment":"Hi @Rathios,\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution, this looks really great!\r\n\r\nThis would be better suited to the core cron module: https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppetlabs-cron_core\r\n\r\nIf you submit it there, please ping me on the PR so I can make sure it gets merged quickly.
