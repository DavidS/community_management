That requires a change to Puppet however as the setup and use of PAL on the agent side for resolution of Deferred must be given the facts to use. (The rest should already be supported by PAL; i.e. setting `$facts` etc.)\r\n\r\nIf not computed and set up front, then I think the result needs to be cached and kept while resolving deferred values. This would be good since if there is no call to get a deferred fact then Facter does not need to run at all. If going this route, there is a supported caching mechanism that functions can use. With this there is still the problem of getting the wrong facts (for server when agent was intended) as the place intention is known is when setting up the context (i.e. when setting up PAL for resolution, or when setting up for apply, master compile, bolt apply compile, etc.).","by":"hlindberg","age_comment":85,"num_comments":7,"no_comment_from_puppet":false,"last_comment_mentions_puppet":false},{"repo":"puppetlabs-stdlib","address":"https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppetlabs-stdlib","pr":1040,"age":205,"owner":"genebean <span class='label label-warning'>puppet</span>","title":"Adding str2saltedpbkdf2 function","last_comment":"I just forgot... sorry!
