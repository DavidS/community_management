Using Litmus you can provision the images on your machine using: \r\n`bundle exec rake litmus:provision['docker_exp','waffleimage/debian8']`\r\nIn order to run the tests install the puppet agent and module using `bundle exec rake litmus:install_agent[puppet5]` and `bundle exec rake litmus:install_module` \r\n\r\nIn your inventory.yaml (will be created after the provisioning) file you will find the necessary details to ssh into the container and run manually from there.\r\n","by":"carabasdaniel","age_comment":0,"num_comments":10,"no_comment_from_puppet":false,"last_comment_mentions_puppet":false},{"repo":"puppetlabs-mysql","address":"https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppetlabs-mysql","pr":1206,"age":240,"owner":"comport3","title":"Fix regression introduced by PR#1175 for managing CRON package","last_comment":"Hello @comport3 ,\r\n\r\nPlease let us know if you're still working on this PR and if we can help you!

That requires a change to Puppet however as the setup and use of PAL on the agent side for resolution of Deferred must be given the facts to use. (The rest should already be supported by PAL; i.e. setting `$facts` etc.)\r\n\r\nIf not computed and set up front, then I think the result needs to be cached and kept while resolving deferred values. This would be good since if there is no call to get a deferred fact then Facter does not need to run at all. If going this route, there is a supported caching mechanism that functions can use. With this there is still the problem of getting the wrong facts (for server when agent was intended) as the place intention is known is when setting up the context (i.e. when setting up PAL for resolution, or when setting up for apply, master compile, bolt apply compile, etc.).","by":"hlindberg","age_comment":69,"num_comments":7,"no_comment_from_puppet":false,"last_comment_mentions_puppet":false},{"repo":"puppetlabs-tagmail","address":"https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppetlabs-tagmail","pr":157,"age":2,"owner":"sheenaajay <span class='label label-warning'>puppet</span>","title":"pdksync - \"(IAC-365) updating tokens and dataset for honeycomb\"","last_comment":"","by":"","age_comment":0,"num_comments":0,"no_comment_from_puppet":true,"last_comment_mentions_puppet":false},{"repo":"puppetlabs-tomcat","address":"https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppetlabs-tomcat","pr":385,"age":2,"owner":"sheenaajay <span class='label label-warning'>puppet</span>","title":"pdksync - \"(IAC-365) updating tokens and dataset for honeycomb\"","last_comment":"","by":"","age_comment":0,"num_comments":0,"no_comment_from_puppet":true,"last_comment_mentions_puppet":false},{"repo":"puppetlabs-tomcat","address":"https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppetlabs-tomcat","pr":379,"age":52,"owner":"DavidS <span class='label label-warning'>puppet</span>","title":"pdksync - (maint) travis updates: bundler and slack","last_comment":"","by":"","age_comment":0,"num_comments":0,"no_comment_from_puppet":true,"last_comment_mentions_puppet":false},{"repo":"puppetlabs-translate","address":"https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppetlabs-translate","pr":69,"age":2,"owner":"sheenaajay <span class='label label-warning'>puppet</span>","title":"pdksync - \"(IAC-365) updating tokens and dataset for honeycomb\"","last_comment":"","by":"","age_comment":0,"num_comments":0,"no_comment_from_puppet":true,"last_comment_mentions_puppet":false},{"repo":"puppetlabs-vcsrepo","address":"https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppetlabs-vcsrepo","pr":444,"age":2,"owner":"sheenaajay <span class='label label-warning'>puppet</span>","title":"pdksync - \"(IAC-365) updating tokens and dataset for honeycomb\"","last_comment":"","by":"","age_comment":0,"num_comments":0,"no_comment_from_puppet":true,"last_comment_mentions_puppet":false},{"repo":"puppetlabs-vcsrepo","address":"https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppetlabs-vcsrepo","pr":418,"age":273,"owner":"evanstachowiak","title":"Don't set --branch equal to revision when depth > 0","last_comment":"hey @lionce,\r\nsorry for the delay.\r\n\r\nAfter further testing, when setting depth == 1, the specific revision was not present in the git clone.
