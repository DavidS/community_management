Trying to break them  into several lines might make the code difficult to understand. There might be a rubocop linter problem complaining about putting a regex into %r{}, as this should be done only when trying to match a \"/\" - which is not the case here as the slashes just enclose the regex.\r\n\r\nWould be happy for some advice here.","by":"janit42","age_comment":3,"num_comments":1,"no_comment_from_puppet":true,"last_comment_mentions_puppet":false},{"repo":"puppetlabs-accounts","address":"https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppetlabs-accounts","pr":289,"age":13,"owner":"sheenaajay <span class='label label-warning'>puppet</span>","title":"DO NOT MERGE Testing Honeycomb update","last_comment":"# [Codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/puppetlabs/puppetlabs-accounts/pull/289?src=pr&el=h1) Report\n> :exclamation: No coverage uploaded for pull request base (`release@d40c5d4`).

That requires a change to Puppet however as the setup and use of PAL on the agent side for resolution of Deferred must be given the facts to use. (The rest should already be supported by PAL; i.e. setting `$facts` etc.)\r\n\r\nIf not computed and set up front, then I think the result needs to be cached and kept while resolving deferred values. This would be good since if there is no call to get a deferred fact then Facter does not need to run at all. If going this route, there is a supported caching mechanism that functions can use.
