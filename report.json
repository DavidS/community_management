However, RHEL5 is EOL so the available docker images are pretty useless and couldn't run all tests. I couldn't find docker images SLES11 so I can't test it at all. Regarding the EL6 failures: Why don't these failures show up in travis, or: why does Puppetlabs use different images for the final tests? Since I can't trigger these failures, I have to ask you for the full error messages for all EL6-like operating systems.","by":"fraenki","age_comment":1,"num_comments":15,"no_comment_from_puppet":false,"last_comment_mentions_puppet":true},{"repo":"puppetlabs-mysql","address":"https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppetlabs-mysql","pr":1206,"age":264,"owner":"comport3","title":"Fix regression introduced by PR#1175 for managing CRON package","last_comment":"![Screen Shot 2020-02-21 at 11 08 25](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/20660680/75030573-4a83bb80-549c-11ea-818a-ccab0bc1621a.png)\r\n","by":"sheenaajay","age_comment":10,"num_comments":14,"no_comment_from_puppet":false,"last_comment_mentions_puppet":false},{"repo":"puppetlabs-mysql","address":"https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppetlabs-mysql","pr":1247,"age":131,"owner":"alexjfisher <span class='label label-primary'>vox</span>","title":"WIP: Improvement to mysql::sql task","last_comment":"@alexjfisher Hey, just wondering if this was work that you intended to continue and if there was any help that you needed?","by":"david22swan","age_comment":6,"num_comments":3,"no_comment_from_puppet":false,"last_comment_mentions_puppet":false},{"repo":"puppetlabs-ntp","address":"https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppetlabs-ntp","pr":560,"age":5,"owner":"carabasdaniel <span class='label label-warning'>puppet</span> <span class='badge badge-secondary'>iac</span>","title":"pdksync - Update weekly scheduled workflows","last_comment":"0 comments","by":"","age_comment":0,"num_comments":0,"no_comment_from_puppet":true,"last_comment_mentions_puppet":false},{"repo":"puppetlabs-ntp","address":"https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppetlabs-ntp","pr":561,"age":4,"owner":"david22swan <span class='label label-warning'>puppet</span> <span class='badge badge-secondary'>iac</span>","title":"pdksync - (maint) - Pdk Update","last_comment":"0 comments","by":"","age_comment":0,"num_comments":0,"no_comment_from_puppet":true,"last_comment_mentions_puppet":false},{"repo":"puppetlabs-postgresql","address":"https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppetlabs-postgresql","pr":1148,"age":5,"owner":"pedrocr","title":"Add Ubuntu 19.04/19.10 compatibility","last_comment":"No previous comment other than codecov-io","by":"","age_comment":1,"num_comments":1,"no_comment_from_puppet":true,"last_comment_mentions_puppet":false},{"repo":"puppetlabs-postgresql","address":"https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppetlabs-postgresql","pr":1144,"age":11,"owner":"carabasdaniel <span class='label label-warning'>puppet</span> <span class='badge badge-secondary'>iac</span>","title":"pdksync - Add weekly scheduled workflows","last_comment":"0 comments","by":"","age_comment":0,"num_comments":0,"no_comment_from_puppet":true,"last_comment_mentions_puppet":false},{"repo":"puppetlabs-postgresql","address":"https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppetlabs-postgresql","pr":1132,"age":48,"owner":"Bouke","title":"Don't update password encrypted with SCRAM-SHA-256 if not changed","last_comment":"@carabasdaniel I'm not familiar with writing tests, but if you can provide me with some pointers for existing test that I can extend, I'd be happy to.

That requires a change to Puppet however as the setup and use of PAL on the agent side for resolution of Deferred must be given the facts to use. (The rest should already be supported by PAL; i.e. setting `$facts` etc.)\r\n\r\nIf not computed and set up front, then I think the result needs to be cached and kept while resolving deferred values. This would be good since if there is no call to get a deferred fact then Facter does not need to run at all. If going this route, there is a supported caching mechanism that functions can use. With this there is still the problem of getting the wrong facts (for server when agent was intended) as the place intention is known is when setting up the context (i.e. when setting up PAL for resolution, or when setting up for apply, master compile, bolt apply compile, etc.).","by":"hlindberg","age_comment":93,"num_comments":7,"no_comment_from_puppet":false,"last_comment_mentions_puppet":false},{"repo":"puppetlabs-stdlib","address":"https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppetlabs-stdlib","pr":1004,"age":360,"owner":"Rathios","title":"(MODULES-8732) Cron types","last_comment":"Hi @Rathios,\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution, this looks really great!\r\n\r\nThis would be better suited to the core cron module: https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppetlabs-cron_core\r\n\r\nIf you submit it there, please ping me on the PR so I can make sure it gets merged quickly.
