Using Litmus you can provision the images on your machine using: \r\n`bundle exec rake litmus:provision['docker_exp','waffleimage/debian8']`\r\nIn order to run the tests install the puppet agent and module using `bundle exec rake litmus:install_agent[puppet5]` and `bundle exec rake litmus:install_module` \r\n\r\nIn your inventory.yaml (will be created after the provisioning) file you will find the necessary details to ssh into the container and run manually from there.\r\n","by":"carabasdaniel","age_comment":3,"num_comments":10,"no_comment_from_puppet":false,"last_comment_mentions_puppet":false},{"repo":"puppetlabs-mysql","address":"https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppetlabs-mysql","pr":1269,"age":61,"owner":"baldurmen","title":"WIP: Don't try to install cron packages by default","last_comment":"I was recently showed the `ensure_package()` function by a colleague and it seems like a much cleaner solution to this problem.

This would be good since if there is no call to get a deferred fact then Facter does not need to run at all. If going this route, there is a supported caching mechanism that functions can use.
